# Leveraging Multimodal Generative AI for Enhancing Digital Well-being and Addressing the Economy of Attention in Public Health

## Overview

This project explores how multimodal generative AI can be utilized to enhance digital well-being and address the challenges posed by the attention economy in the realm of public health. It introduces a novel framework, **ManiGen**, which unifies manifold-aligned latent spaces using a geometry-aware synthesis strategy to create adaptive, context-aware, and semantically aligned AI outputs.

## Motivation

With increasing concerns over digital well-being and the cognitive overload resulting from hyperconnected environments, public health strategies must adapt to mitigate these risks. Traditional AI methods often rely on shallow cross-modal integration and heuristic encoders, limiting their generalizability and adaptability in real-world applications.

## Key Contributions

- **ManiGen Framework**: A geometry-aware multimodal generative AI approach that respects the inherent structure of different modalities.
- **GeoPrompt-driven Synthesis**: Utilizes Riemannian latent manifold alignment and prompt-based learning to enhance semantic coherence across text, image, and structured data.
- **Attention Economy Mitigation**: Targets digital overstimulation through adaptive content generation tailored for individual well-being.
- **Public Health Applications**: Demonstrates the utility of the approach in supporting personalized interventions and policy-level insights.

## Methodology

- Unified manifold learning in non-Euclidean latent spaces.
- Cross-domain prompt-driven synthesis using semantic alignment.
- Integration across linguistic, visual, and structured modalities.
- Extensive experiments across public health datasets validate the approach.
